## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a chatbot that can assist with customer inquiries at a call center using OpenAI and Streamlit. The target audience are staff members who handle customer queries, who interact with the bot through a chat interface and receive responses from the model. It includes features such as buttons for starting new conversations and clearing the chat history, sliders to adjust temperature and top P parameters, and select boxes to choose between different models for generating responses.

| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**  | Cosmin-T's Buddy-X is a Python application that utilizes various open-source libraries and frameworks to provide functionality for natural language processing and machine learning. The project's architecture is built upon Flask, a Python web framework, with support for various other libraries including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyMySQL.                                                                                                                          |
| 🔩   | **Code Quality**  | The code quality of Buddy-X is good, with a focus on maintainability and readability. The project's codebase adheres to PEP 8 standards for Python code style, and uses tools such as Flake8 and PyUpgrade to ensure consistency in formatting and syntax. The use of linting and code quality plugins helps to identify and address potential issues early in the development process, ensuring that the overall codebase is high-quality and well-maintained.                 |
| 📄   | **Documentation** | The documentation for Buddy-X is comprehensive, with a focus on providing clear instructions for getting started with the project. The documentation includes information on how to set up the application, use common APIs, and access key features like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech tagging (POS). The documentation also provides examples of how to implement custom features using third-party libraries and frameworks.                             |
| 🔌   | **Integrations**  | Buddy-X integrates with various external dependencies, including third-party libraries for natural language processing and machine learning. The project utilizes libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyMySQL to perform common tasks like text classification, entity recognition, and data storage. In addition, the project uses frameworks like Flask and PyQt5 to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the underlying algorithms.            |
| 🧩   | **Modularity**    | Buddy-X's codebase is modular and easily extendable, allowing developers to add new functionality or customize existing features without modifying core components of the project. The project makes use of dependency injection principles to promote loose coupling between different modules and libraries, ensuring that changes to one component do not have a ripple effect on the entire codebase.                                                                       |
| 🧪   | **Testing**       | Buddy-X utilizes various testing frameworks and tools, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing. The project's test coverage is high, with a focus on ensuring that new functionality and changes are thoroughly tested before deployment. Additionally, the use of testing frameworks like Pytest and Unittest helps to identify potential issues early in the development process, ensuring that the overall codebase is reliable and well-maintained. |

| [telegram_bot.py](https://github.com/Cosmin-T/Buddy-X.git/blob/master/telegram_bot.py)   | This file contains Python code for generating a unique abstract letter monogram logo design based on the initial letters X and Z. The logo is designed using a vector graphic program called Adobe Illustrator and then exported as an SVG image format to create a stylized version of the monogram letter XZ that can be used in various contexts, such as corporate logos, product branding, and website design. The code also includes functions for querying a database to retrieve specific user-inputted letters from which the logo should be created. These features allow the user to generate customized versions of this logo that fit their personal taste or company's branding guidelines. Overall, the purpose of the code is to create a versatile and visually appealing design element using modern software tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| [util.py](https://github.com/Cosmin-T/Buddy-X.git/blob/master/slack_logic/util.py)   | This file contains the utilities required for slack_logic. The from dotenv import load_dotenv' and import os are used to fetch and save environment variables using the dotenv package, respectively. These environment variables are stored in.env which is then imported through load_dotenv(). This file contains an os.getenv() function to extract any required variable from a specified path using the os module.This code is crucial for executing commands in the slack_logic repository as it allows the system to retrieve environment variables stored in.env', thereby providing secure access to sensitive data within the project. The file is responsible for managing and maintaining the repository's architecture and should be treated with due care, especially during implementation. |

It defines a function named `hello_list`, which is intended for use with other Python programs or modules. The `def` keyword at the beginning of the code defines that this is an `importable` statement. Then, it provides several sample strings that could be used for greetings or salutations in different contexts and languages. These greeting strings are formatted into a list and returned to other Python programs using the `list()` function. This makes them easily accessible as a variable to call in any scripting language. In terms of its contribution to the overall repository architecture, this code file provides an essential function that simplifies communication between modules or scripts for more complex applications. |
| [query_db.py](https://github.com/Cosmin-T/Buddy-X.git/blob/master/logic/query_db.py)     | This file belongs to an open-source project that implements SQLAlchemy database library for storing and retrieving data from relational databases. It is designed to generate an engine object along with its metadata using the provided initial connection details in a method called initialize_database(). Additionally, it also provides methods like itteration(), generate_db_chain() which help you to interact with the SQLAlchemy database chain and generate the necessary SQL queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| [document.wflow](https://github.com/Cosmin-T/Buddy-X.git/blob/master/slack.workflow/Contents/document.wflow) | This action file creates a script that launches Terminal with specific arguments for each step in the workflow. By default, it uses bash as its shell executable. If desired, steps can specify custom shells to use for their arguments by editing the workflow accordingly. Step 1 uses /bin/sh. To specify a different shell, such as /usr/local/bin/fish, replace /bin/sh in that step with /path/to/shell. The script requires accessibility permissions on macOS Mojave or later. This means it will be unavailable to run on older operating systems such as Catalina 10.15 and earlier, which do not provide those permissions by default. However, these steps can be excluded from the workflow if they are incompatible with your environment. Finally, the action file does not specify any unique identifier for this script, so you can rename or duplicate it however you'd like to suit your needs. |
